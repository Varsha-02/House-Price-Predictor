# House-Price-Predictor
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict house prices using various features, providing a valuable tool for informed decisions in the real estate market, with a focus on data collection, model selection, and user-friendly deployment.

Problem Statement
The housing market is a critical component of the economy, and for individuals and families, purchasing a home is often the most substantial financial decision they'll ever make. Predicting house prices accurately is crucial for enabling informed decisions among both buyers and sellers. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict house prices, taking into account a variety of influential factors, including location, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other relevant features.

1. Introduction:<br>
Background:<br>
The housing market is a vital part of the economy, and accurate house price prediction can aid buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions. Machine learning provides a powerful tool to analyse historical data and make predictions based on various attributes of a house.
Objective:<br>
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict house prices accurately. By considering factors such as location, square footage, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other relevant features, we aim to provide a valuable tool for individuals and organizations involved in the real estate market.
Scope:<br>
This project's scope includes data collection, pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment. The machine learning model will predict house prices based on a dataset that incorporates various features.

2. Data Collection and Pre-processing:<br>
Data Sources:<br>
Data for this project will be collected from various sources, including real estate listings, government housing databases, and open data platforms. The dataset will include information about houses, such as location, size, age, amenities, and historical pricing.
Data Cleaning:<br>
Before analysis, the data will undergo preprocessing, which includes handling missing values, removing outliers, and converting categorical variables into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.
Feature Engineering:<br>
Feature engineering will involve creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power. For example, calculating the price per square foot or considering neighbourhood-specific factors.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):<br>
EDA is a critical step to gain insights into the data. It will involve data visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.

4. Machine Learning Model:<br>
Model Selection:<br>
Several regression algorithms will be considered, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost. The choice of the best-performing model will depend on factors like accuracy, interpretability, and ease of deployment.
Model Training:<br>
The selected model will be trained on the pre-processed dataset using techniques like cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
Model Evaluation:<br>
The model's performance will be assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2). The goal is to develop a model that minimizes prediction errors.

5. Deployment:<br>
User Interface:<br>
A user-friendly web interface will be developed to allow users to input house features and obtain predicted prices. This interface will serve as a practical tool for buyers and sellers.
Hosting the Model:<br>
The machine learning model will be deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure) to ensure accessibility and scalability. API endpoints will be created for integration into the user interface.

6. Conclusion:<br>
Summary of Findings:<br>
This project aims to create a powerful house price prediction tool using machine learning techniques. By analysing historical data and considering various house features, we intend to provide a reliable means of predicting house prices.
Future Work:<br>
In the future, we can further enhance the model by incorporating additional features, such as economic indicators, and explore more advanced machine learning techniques like deep learning. Continuous model monitoring and updates will also be essential to adapt to changing market conditions.
By accurately predicting house prices, this project aims to empower individuals and organizations to make informed decisions in the dynamic housing market.
